# hubot-shell
Attaches node's child_process module to hubot for easy interaction with the host. Useful for a wide range of troubleshooting.

## Optional Dependencies:
 - hubot-auth - Required to specify role for shell users. Defaults to allow anyone shell access. This is an obvious security risk so its recommended you use [hubot-auth](https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-auth) and specify a role for shell access with `SHELL_ROLE`. As an alternative, at least restrict shell actions to a peer reviewed chat room by defining `SHELL_ROOM`.

## Configuration:
 - SHELL_ROLE - Role authorized to execute shell commands from hubot. Requires hubot-auth
 - SHELL_ROOM - Limit shell commands to a specific room. Useful to peer review actions

## Commands:
 - hubot shell `command` - Executes a subprocess and sends stdout upon completion. Waits for command to complete before responding.
 - hubot spawn shell `command` -  Spawns a subprocess and streams stdout back to chat. Useful for viewing stdout in real-time.

## Usage:
